# event-source-writer
create a server-sent events (EventSource) compatible stream

Unlike some other modules, this doesn't do anything with HTTP or any other
transport. Rather, it lets you serialize events to a Readable stream. For
example, you might choose to pipe it to logs or HTTP or what have you.


## install
```console
$ npm install event-source-writer
```

## usage
```js
var EventSourceWriter = require('event-source-writer')

var source = new EventSourceWriter()

source.pipe(process.stdout)

source.dispatchEvent({event: 'keypress', data: {keyCode: 72}})
source.dispatchEvent({event: 'keypress', data: {keyCode: 73})
source.dispatchEvent({event: 'keypress', data:{keyCode: 13})
source.end()
```
outputs the events serialized as specified in the [Server-Sent Events spec][]

```console


event: keypress
data: {"keyCode":72}

event: keypress
data: {"keyCode":73}

event: keypress
data: {"keyCode":13}


:end

```


## notes
`event-source-writer` will emit a keepalive to the stream every 10 seconds.
This helps prevent some systems from closing connections before the stream
has ended.


## Static functions

### `EventSourceWriter.serialize(eventName?: String, data?: Object) => String`

Both `eventName` and `data` are optional. In a common case, you'll supply both a string for the name of the event and an object for any event properties.

Example:
```js
EventSourceWriter.serialize('coffeeready', {time: 'now'})
// => 
// event: coffeeready
// data: {"time":"now"}
//
```

## `EventSourceWriter.comment(String) => String`

Creates a comment (line starting with `:`) and ensures there are no
extraneous linefeeds.
